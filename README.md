This is a test project for practicing vue.js skills and some css.

The goal is to build a full fledged cook book / meal planner app which stores recipes and makes it super easy to plan meals for a period of time. The app will ideally also output a shopping list with all the necessary ingredients.

The app is currently in a early development phase, so there's probably no value in running it locally. I'll add a setup guide once it becomes relevant.

I might or might not publish this app as a hosted service once it's in a production-ready phase.
